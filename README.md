# yt-dlp-gui
 A GUI for yt-dlp, a continuation of youtube-dl
 VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS, ONLY HAS BASIC DOWNLOAD/FORMAT FUNCTIONALITY AT THE MOMENT
 Most of the UI still needs to be implemented.
 This is more of a fun project for me, not meant to be a full-fledged all bells and whistles downloader yet.
 I plan to add more features and improve the UI in the future, after all basic functionalities are implemented.
 Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments, they are always welcome.
